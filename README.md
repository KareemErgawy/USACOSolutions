USACOSolutions
==============

My solutions to USACO programming problems (cerberus.delosent.com:791/usacogate)

THESE ARE SPOILERS. Please, if you intend to solve USACO probelms don't look at these solutions unless you tried your best.

Note about source files:
------------------------
All CPP files here are either named:

1. `Main.cpp`: is this purely my code. I came up with the algorithms in these files and solutions are totally mine.
2. `MainX.cpp`: where X is a number (1, 2, 3, ...). These are my implmementations for the solutions provided by USACO website. After you successfully solve a problem on USACO the website unlocked the analysis for this problem so that you can look at how other solved that problem. I usually look at the analysis and if I find an interesting idea I implement it myself so that I guarantee that I grasped the concept.

`Interesting material` folder:
------------------------------
This folder contains material that I found helpful solving one or more problems. I hope to gather great study material here.
